=============

How many hours did it take to complete? **7 hours**

Which required and optional stories have you completed?

**Required Tasks**
- [x] Creating the Tip Calculator
- [x] Adding Tip Calculator Settings Page
- [x] Designing the Settings Page
- [x] Loading and Saving via View Controller Lifecycle

**Optional Tasks**
- [x] Change the colors and fonts of the views. There are really only a few key views in iOS, each with a few key properties, so it's good to start tinkering with them. The commonly used views are: labels, images, text fields, and buttons. Then, there are two more complex views called a table view and a collection view. If you master all these, you're well on your way.
- [x] Add a custom font
- [x] Add an app icon and launch image, see the guide below.
- [ ] Remember the bill amount across app restarts. After an extended period of time, clear the state. This is a UI trick that Apple uses with the Spotlight app. If you return there a minute later, it will show your most recent search. if you return 10 minutes later, it defaults to blank. To implement this, plug into the application lifecycle and track time using NSDate.
- [ ] Use locale specific currency and currency thousands separators.
- [ ] Add a light/dark color theme to the settings view. In viewWillAppear, update views with the correct theme colors.
